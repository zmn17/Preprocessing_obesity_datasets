# Childhood Obesity Data â€“ Environmental Factors

This repository contains datasets and resources for Phase 1 of our Capstone project, which focuses on building a machine learning model to predict childhood obesity.  
In this phase, the primary goal is to collect, clean, and prepare datasets related to environmental factors influencing childhood obesity.
